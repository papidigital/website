                                <p>This podcast is centered around Joe Pistone who was the undercover FBI agent that infiltrated
                                    the New York Mafia in the late 70s. The goal was to test the market and determine the
                                    viability of this podcast. Through this test, we discovered the audience and the type of
                                    content that appeals to users.</p>
                                <p>The results of this test were shocking. Not only did we discover an audience but this
                                    campaign broke paid ad records for podcasting. This test sets how podcast marketing will be
                                    done in the future. This also happens to a really cool podcast, listen to it if you get a
                                    chance!</p>

                                            <p>We used Audience Insights to find the audience. It was a lot of trial and error.
                                                We searched for mafia-related interests to see if Facebook had an audience for it.
                                                We searched for law enforcement interests.</p>
                                            <p>Based on several types of approaches we made a “hypotheses” that targeting mob-related
                                                movies would be the best performer (it was only an educated guess). We based our
                                                selection around 90s mafia movies. We assumed they would have likely seen “Donnie Brasco.”</p>

                                            <h2>Assets we chose and why</h2>
                                            <p>Assets were tricky with this campaign. The main reason is that Facebook has been denying
                                                a lot of “sensational.” This IP has a lot of drugs, gambling, and murders we needed to
                                                be careful with what we selected. The logic was to identify the most provocative clips
                                                we could find</p>
                                            <p>At that point, we picked the ones we believed Facebook would approve
                                                (again this is a guess). It was a test, but to hedge, we used 5 different clips. We did
                                                get lucky and overtime we were able to get them all approved. We did get our fair share
                                                of Facebook denials.</p>

                                                            We tested out the audience which we called

                                                            explains how he infiltrated the mafia posing as a jewel thief.
                                                            Our results netted a $0.02 cost per click in this test.
                                                            Which was almost not believable. At that point we knew we

                                                            Our best asset was getting us $0.03 per click and our worst

                                                            to push those assets over a larger spend to see if it
                                                            scaled. We used
                                                            “Donnie The Jewel Theif” and “Mafia’ Guy’s Wife or Daughter”
                                                            even with scaling the budget these assets held up and didn’t
                                                            exceed $0.08.</p>
