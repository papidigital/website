                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>This podcast is centered around Joe Pistone who was the undercover FBI agent that infiltrated
                            the New York Mafia in the late 70s. The goal was to test the market and determine the
                            viability of this podcast. Through this test, we discovered the audience and the type of
                            content that appeals to users.</p>
                        <p>The results of this test were shocking. Not only did we discover an audience but this
                            campaign broke paid ad records for podcasting. This test sets how podcast marketing will be
                            done in the future. This also happens to a really cool podcast, listen to it if you get a
                            chance!</p>

                            <h2>Market research involved, and how we determined our target audience</h2>
                            <p>We used Audience Insights to find the audience. It was a lot of trial and error.
                                We searched for mafia-related interests to see if Facebook had an audience for it.
                                We searched for law enforcement interests.</p>
                            <p>Based on several types of approaches we made a “hypotheses” that targeting mob-related
                                movies would be the best performer (it was only an educated guess). We based our
                                selection around 90s mafia movies. We assumed they would have likely seen “Donnie Brasco.”</p>
