                        Unfortunately, it can be difficult and expensive to attract listeners to your podcast. Podcast
                        marketing still needs to catch up with other types of media marketing.

                            Marketing </h1>

                        <p>Choosing to advertise on another podcast is expensive, feels forced, and it can be difficult
                            to
                            track results. Traditional podcast marketing gives you a cost per thousand (CPM) listeners.
                            The
                            more popular a podcast is, the more expensive the advertising rates will be. The average
                            rate is
                            around $25 CPM for a 60-second ad. These prices translate to about $5 to $15 per listener.
                        </p>

                        <p>Along with the high costs, the advertising can often feel unnatural and forced, which can
                            potentially turn off listeners. Even if you do get new listeners after spending thousands of
                            dollars to advertise on another podcast, there is almost no way to track where those
                            listeners
                            came from. There is no trail to follow from one podcast to another.</p>

                                <p> &#x25cf Stage 3: After gathering statistics from the previous two stages, we examine how well
                                    each asset is performing and calculate the “cost per listen.” We want this rate to

                                        territory for most. Growth hacks for your podcast can make all the difference
                                        between building an audience of fanatical followers or your only listeners. Papi
                                        Digital deciphers the most successful designs for growing your podcast. </p>
                                    <p>This uncertainty is due to the lack of tools and methods that make other digital
                                        communication methods predictable. What Papi Digital has done is break down how
                                        podcasts achieve success and grade the key components of the process. Let's take

                                                <p>In this case we made five different versions of an episode. We took
                                                    the top of the episode and made an advantage of it. We provided
                                                    headspace for our creatives, but they had brand concerns that led
                                                    them to ask for several different versions. The problem with
                                                    advertising a podcast on Facebook is that it is an audio medium.
                                                    Most people scroll down, and it turns out that sound is not an
                                                    option for most people. Only 23% of Facebook users scroll down
                                                    because they like sound (source puts the figure at 15%), so this is
                                                    the wrong approach and a waste of money. Talking heads and videos
                                                    are not the way to go. </p>
